# FocusApp

## Project Pitch
Our initial idea was motivated by our daily needs as university students. As a result of the intensive workload, being focus is essential to fulfill academic goals and catch deadlines. However, the modern smartphones have caused too many interruptions to our study. Therefore we decided to implement a Focus app.  

As we are aware of, there are many similar apps in the market. In order to make our app unique and interesting, we implemented a surprise  incentive mechanism., which means users can only know what the surprise seed will grown up to when they finish their focus period. All the plants will be recorded in a collection book that they can share with friends. Plants are categorized using different rarity level to increase userâ€™s interest. In this way, we believe that we can make a pretty boring task more fun.
